# Python Template Repository Documentation

### HW1 Technology Template Repository
Based on the assignment requirements, here are the technology choices we made for our Python project template repository:

1. Programming Language:
   - Choice: Python

2. Interpreter:
   - Choice: CPython

3. Testing Framework:
   - Choice: pytest for writing and executing tests

4. Dependency Management:
   - Choice: uv as a modern Python package management tool
   - uv provides faster package installation and dependency resolution than pip

5. Code Formatting:
   - Choice: ruff for code formatting and static analysis

6. Static Analysis Tools:
   - Choice: mypy for type checking
   - Choice: ruff for code quality checks

7. Code Coverage:
   - Choice: coverage.py for test coverage analysis

8. Continuous Integration:
   - Choice: CircleCI, configured in .circleci/config.yml
   - Automated testing, static analysis, and code coverage reporting

9. Component Specification:
   - Implementation: The template includes a structured approach to project organization
   - Source code is divided by components in the src directory
   - Each component has its own API and tests
   - Detailed documentation in docs/component.md

10. Issue and Pull Request Templates:
    - Setup: Created issue and PR templates in the .github directory
    - Standardized submission process for clear, structured contributions

11. Component Implementation:
    - Calculator: Performs basic arithmetic operations
    - Logger: Records operations
    - Notifier: Sends notifications when results exceed a threshold

12. Test Implementation:
    - Unit Tests: Test the functionality of individual components
    - Integration Tests: Test interactions between components
    - End-to-End Tests: Test complete workflows

Our goal is to meet the assignment requirements while adopting modern best practices in Python development. The use of tools like uv and ruff reflects our forward-looking approach to Python project management, balancing assignment requirements with the evolving Python tooling ecosystem.
